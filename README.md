# The ULTIMATIVE ZIH simulation

This repository houses a simulation of the *ZIH* station for the ESE game, annually hosted by the @fsr.

## Requirements

The script is written in Python 3, designed to run in a **unix-like** environment and uses the [termcolor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor) package, which comes in a (maybe outdated, but working) version in this repository.


This script still needs some comments and cleanup but everything works right now as intended.

## Changes to be done for the next year

You might want to adjust a few things for the next year. Things like the commands for secrets (`semester++`, `42` and so on), so that future "Erstis" won't know how they can cheat.
